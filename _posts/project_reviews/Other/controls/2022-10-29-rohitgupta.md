**Project type**: Summer Project

**Motivation to pursue project**: I was interested in how to numerically & accurately simulate spaceflight trajectories. So the prof suggested me the CR3BP to begin with.

**Summary of Project**: 
The work involved the study of Hamiltonian and Lagrangian mechanics to model the CR3BP and generate a solution using symplectic integration schemes for different cases.
I developed a python code to simulate the system for different initial conditions and observe the resulting trajectories while making sure to have the system invariants remain constant.
