Introduction to parallel programming concepts and parallel algorithms. Effective use of command line Linux. Use of version control systems such as Git/SVN/Mercurial. Introduction to OpenMP and thread programming. Introduction to MPI programming. Introduction to GPGPU / Vector programming Effective use of debuggers and parallel debugging. Performance analysis of parallel programming. Overview of toolkits such as BLAS, LAPACK, PETSC Advanced scientific visualisation.

**Weightage:**
Assignments- 20%
Project- 40%
End sem- 40%

**How are the Lectures/Labs for this course?**
Lectures were very interesting. Instructor is enthusiastic and takes interest in learning of the students. There will be demonstrations in the class regarding the use of parallel programming libraries and the various APIs used in the libraries which help in understanding of the parallel algorithms and multiple processes.

Paying attention in the lectures is sufficient to do well in assignments, project and end semester exams. 

**How are the Assignments & Projects for this course?:**
We had 3 assignments for this course. The first assignment was to parallelize numerical integration method (trapezoid and montecarlo methods) using openmp and to compare the performance with the serial code. The second assignment was to parallelize the same numerical integration problem using MPI and using gpu programming (CUDA or opencl). The third assignment did not involve any programming. We were required to get the code profiling output for the codes in assignments 1 and 2 using gprof and valgrind and get some statistics such as hit and miss rate and call graph of the programs. 

The course project is done in a team of 4 students. The topic of the project can be selected from the list of past topics provided or the team can come with their own idea. Some really interesting projects such as Parallelising Eigenface based face recognition, Deep Learning using OpenCL, Parallel Neural Network Framework, Portfolio management using Particle Swarm Optimization, etc., were done by the students. The marks of the project was distributed among the code, report, presentation and individual contribution of each member.

Overall, the project and assignments immensely help in the understanding of the concepts and provide a good learning experience.

**Other Remarks:**
Familiarity with basic programming in C/C++ and basic use of linux terminal is required before taking this course as there will not be any tutorials or labs for the parallel programming libraries

**References used in this course:**
None

**How strongly would you recommend someone for taking this course?:**
Strongly recommended
