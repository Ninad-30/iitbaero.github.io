**Project Guide:** Prof Rajkumar S Pant

**Time Commitment Required:** 1 - 4 hrs per week

**Project Description:**  
This was a consultancy project given to the institute by a company(I will not be disclosing much of company details as there is a privacy policy regulation). We were involved in vetting the technical report of a 6 seater aircraft made by a private company. We were asked to use ab initio methods validate the technical file. CFD simulations also had to be gone through. This being a consultancy project, we were paid for our work.

**Grading:** Very Strict

**This Project has:** Literature Review, Theoretical Formulation

**Recommended Prerequisites:** Aircraft design

**Other Areas of Interest of the Project Guide:** Optimization, LTA technology, Aircraft design

**Remarks by author:**  
Nothing much of any research involved. It was more like an application of what we learn in lectures. It was fun working side by side with a company. I wouldn't recommend a consultancy project for hardcore research enthu people.
