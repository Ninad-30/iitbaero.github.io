**Course Instructor:** Prof. Hemendra Arya

**Course Difficulty:** Moderate

**Time Commitment Required:** High

**Grading:** Strict

**Attendance Policy:** No DX enforced but attendance contributes to grade

**Pre-Requisites:** None

**This Course has:** Quizzes, Project(s), Mid-Sem, End-Sem

**Topics Covered in the Course:**
Characteristics of measuring systems: Calibration, sensitivity and error analysis.

Flow measurements: Hotwire anemometer, manometer, angle of attack sensor
Temperature Measurements: Thermocouples, hot gas and cryogenic measurements,
thermopiles
Strain measurements: Strain gage types, strain gage sensitivity.
Pressure measurements: Dependence of measurement dynamics on sensor
construction.
Inertial and GPS based sensors: Accelerometers and gyroscopes; position, velocity
and time measurements.
Attitude and heading reference systems: Errors in inertial sensors and
characterization.
Sensor interfacing: amplifiers, filters, and other signal conditioning
circuits, analog and digital conditioning, ADC/DAC, synchronous and
asynchronous serial communication.

**How are the Lectures/Labs for this course?**
Lectures are good. The labs are also good with respect to both Aerospace and electrical related knowledge. You will be using a lot of electrical components in the experiments as well as the final proeject.

**How are the Assignments & Projects for this course?:**
No Assignments. One project that is also selected by you and also it is very easy.

**How are the Exams (Quizzes, Mid-sem and End-sem) for this course?**
Exams are mostly theoretical and questions are mostly from slides given by professor and very less questions are asked from experiments.

**Other Remarks:**
If you already have a descent background of electrical it will be easy for you to get a good grade.

**References used in this course:**
Slides and other material provided by professor is enough.

**How strongly would you recommend someone for taking this course?:**
Not Recommended
