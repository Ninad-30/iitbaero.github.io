**Project Guide:** Prof. C.S Yerramalli and A. Paranjape

**Time Commitment Required:** 1 - 4 hrs per week

**Project Description:**  
This project involved surveying literature about the implementation of Control in Wind Turbines and learning the usage of a software FAST. This software is used for simulating the runs of a wind turbine for different configurations of the blade and obtain performance results for the same.

**Grading:** Chill

**This Project has:** Literature Review, Simulations

**Recommended Prerequisites:** Control Theory, Solid Mechanics

**Other Areas of Interest of the Project Guide:** Structural optimization of wind turbine blades, Study of Composites used in Aerospace applications

**Remarks by author:**  
This project is good but might require a significant time investment in understanding the FAST software as it is a bare bones code with minimal GUI.

**Project References:**  


**How interesting was the project:** Fairly Interesting

**How strongly would you recommend someone for taking a similar project (Not recommended-Strongly Recommended)?**  
Neutral
