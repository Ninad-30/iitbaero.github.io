**Project Guide:** Prof. Ashok Joshi

**Time Commitment Required:** 1 - 4 hrs per week

**Project Description:**  
The project for more of a learning project for me to learn further topics in the spaceflight mechanics/astrodynamics field. I read about various perturbations to Kepler orbits and then modeled J2 perturbations on python. Finally I compared my model to NOAA-10 satellite data.

**Grading:** Chill

**This Project has:** Programming/Coding, Literature Review, Simulations

**Recommended Prerequisites:** Spaceflight Mechanics

**Other Areas of Interest of the Project Guide:** Controls

**Remarks by author:**  
I went to Ashok Joshi sir for this project and hence I liked the work. It was completely my idea and mostly a self project. Joshi sir helped me once or twice when I was struck.
