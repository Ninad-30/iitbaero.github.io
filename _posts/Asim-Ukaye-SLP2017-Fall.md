**Project Guide:** R.P. Shimpi

**Time Commitment Required:** Less than an hour a week

**Project Description:**  
This project involved surveying literature and implementing popularly published results about optimizing the configuration of wind farms to maximize power generation and minimize cost using stochastic algorithms such as GA, SA and PSO. The second phase involved analysing the effects of terrain on such an optimization problem. MATLAB was used to formulate the optimization problem and simulate the results of the configuration

**Grading:** Chill

**This Project has:** Programming/Coding, Literature Review, Simulations

**Recommended Prerequisites:** None, some basic know-how of MATLAB would be good.
