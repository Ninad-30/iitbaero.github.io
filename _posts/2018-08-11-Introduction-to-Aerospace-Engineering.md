**How are the Lectures/Labs for this course?**
The course content is really cool and I have enjoyed learning it. Most of the things are fairly easy to understand. But it has been observed that the lecture can get monotonous at times and students  start losing interest. As long as you are paying attention to the content , the lectures are really useful and interesting.

**How are the Assignments & Projects for this course?:**
During our year we were divided into groups and were asked to make a PPT about various airplane crashes in the world. This gave as an opportunity to learn more about the structure and functioning of airplanes. 

**How are the Exams (Quizzes, Mid-sem and End-sem) for this course?**
The exams are a bit tough. You need to be really thorough about the concepts when you answer the questions. The professor also gives a great weightage to diagrams in the answers. The correction pattern for the exams are also usually very strict and often the whole class ends up with a low average; but always try to stay on top to get good grades.
