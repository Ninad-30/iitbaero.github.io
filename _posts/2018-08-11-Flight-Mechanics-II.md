**How are the Lectures/Labs for this course?**
Lectures are very interactive and filled with practical examples and videos. Much use was made of surprise conceptual quizzes to revise concepts. Conceptual and easy to understand delivery

**How are the Assignments & Projects for this course?:**
Assignments are basically problem sets. Some were erroneous leading to confusion among students, however the overall layout and questions were well-designed and contributed to conceptual understanding

The project was based on linearizing dynamics about a non-standard situation  and properly tested basic concept application. It also included matlab simulation for control responses and was well-designed.

**How are the Exams (Quizzes, Mid-sem and End-sem) for this course?**
Exams are easy and contribute to understanding of course material. Solving problems from Nelson is recommended

**References used in this course:**
Nelson R. C., Flight Stability and Automatic Control - Recommended
Etkin, B. and Reid, L. D, Dynamics of Flight - Dynamics part is well explained

**How strongly would you recommend someone for taking this course?:**
Strongly Recommended
