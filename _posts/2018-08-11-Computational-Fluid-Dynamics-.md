Basic equations of fluid dynamics and levels of approximation. Mathematical nature of the flow equations & their boundary conditions. Grids and transformations. Basic discretization techniques applied to model equations and systems of equations:finite difference, finite volume and finite element methods. Analysis of numerical schemes: concept of consistency, stability and convergence. Error and stability analysis. Some applications.

**Weightage:**
Assignments,5,55%    Quiz,2,20%    Endsem,1,25%

**How are the Lectures/Labs for this course?**
Lectures were monotonous, after few weeks I felt bored with Prof's teaching. 
He mostly follows a book by Prof. M. Ramakrishna, in which explanation is better, but sir himself is interested in student's learning. He is very knowledgeable and clear the doubts you have. 

**How are the Assignments & Projects for this course?:**
Assignments were exhaustive and moderately tough, it has to be done in Python only. It is graded on various levels including your programming skills, neatness of code e.t.c

**How are the Exams (Quizzes, Mid-sem and End-sem) for this course?:**
Assignments were exhaustive and moderately tough, it has to be done in Python only. It is graded on various levels including your programming skills, neatness of code e.t.c

**Other Remarks:**
This course can help you figure out if Computational Fluid Dynamics is for you or not.
