**How are the Lectures/Labs for this course?**  
The lectures are comprehensive and thorough. The lecture slides are very descriptive and serve as good study material. 

**How are the Assignments & Projects for this course?**  
The assignment usually involves flow Simulation and is very interesting. It also requires a decent amount of time to complete.

**How are the Exams (Quizzes, Mid-sem and End-sem) for this course?**  
Exams, while more challenging than other 3rd sem courses, can be easily solved with adequate preparation and proper understanding of the course content.

**Other Remarks:**  
The grading scheme is as follows. Only if the highest score is greater than 85 on 100 in an absolute scale will any AAs be awarded. Further, everybody's score is normalised with the highest score and then grades are awarded. A normalised score between 90 and 100 will get an AA, 80 to 90 an AB and so on. FR is awarded below 35.
