**How are the Lectures/Labs for this course?**
This course only contains Lectures, they are very interesting and prof's teaching methodology was also good and you will never get bored in class. Prof was also strict on student's behavior in class. Prof also give various numerical data in class use it to explain the topic and compare the performance. 

Just being attentive in class, you can easily score 8 or more in this course. 

**How are the Assignments & Projects for this course?:**
We were only given 2 Assignments in this course. First assignment, contained some question to solve and also to get various propellant performance profile by using an open source software. Second assignment only contain some questions. 
Overall assignments are easy and with little effort it can be easily done.

**How are the Exams (Quizzes, Mid-sem and End-sem) for this course?**
In general, exam are different from what you expect. Prof. always surprised us with type of question in exam. In general, exam were moderate. From derivation to numerical problems, one word answer.
Overall exam were moderate.

**Other Remarks:**
It is one of the scoring subject and one can easily score 9 or 10 in it.
