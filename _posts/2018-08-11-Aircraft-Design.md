**Course Instructor:** Prof. Avijit Chatterjee

**Course Difficulty:** Moderate

**Time Commitment Required:** Moderate

**Grading:** Chill

**Attendance Policy:** No DX enforced but attendance contributes to grade

**Pre-Requisites:** AE 152 (Intro to Aerospace Engineering) only

**This Course has:** Quizzes, Mid-Sem, End-Sem

**Topics Covered in the Course:**
Introduction to Aircraft Design: Three phases in aircraft design, Computer based aircraft design methodologies, differences between LTA and HTA aircraft, type of civil and military aircraft.
Configuration and Layout: Types and comparison of wing, tail, fuselage, landing gear, wing-tail combinations, power plant (types, numbers, locations), unconventional aircraft configurations.
Sizing and Constraint Analysis: Initial sizing, estimation of design gross weight, rubber engine sizing and fixed engine sizing, refined sizing method and constraint analysis.
Estimation Methodologies: Lift and drag coefficient, design loads,
component mass breakdown, acquisition cost, direct operating cost.
Operational and Environmental Issues: Range-payload diagram, V-n diagram, noise and emission levels

**Weightage:**
Quiz, 2 , 20%
Midsem, 1, 30%
Endsem, 1, 40%
Attendance 10%

**How are the Lectures/Labs for this course?**
Very informative but also highly factual. There are very little to no formulae in this course. Most of this courses consists of learning how various configurations, parts, etc can affect aircraft design and performance. This course also teaches you how to start with the design of any aircraft from a basic sizing perspective to a more detailed multidisciplinary outlook.

**How are the Exams (Quizzes, Mid-sem and End-sem) for this course?**
Fairly simple but at least one question in each test will be tricky. This is the question that brings about the difference in grades

**Other Remarks:**
It would help if one brushes up Aerodynamics and Flight Mechanics before taking this course to be able to grasp concepts more easily instead of taking things for granted

**References used in this course:**
Raymer, D. P., Aircraft Design - A Conceptual Approach, AIAA Educational Series, 4th Ed., 2006.


**How strongly would you recommend someone for taking this course?:**
Strongly recommended
