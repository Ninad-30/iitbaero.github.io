**Course Instructor:** Prof. Prabhu Ramachandran

**Course Difficulty:** Moderate

**Time Commitment Required:** Moderate

**Grading:** Chill

**Attendance Policy:** No mandatory attendance but Sir took attendance himself and hence was aware whenever any student was missing classes. Therefore, you might not want to miss classes consecutively.

**Pre-Requisites:** None

**This Course has:** Quizzes, Assignment(s), Project(s), Mid-Sem, End-Sem

**Topics Covered in the Course:**
The role of statistics, Graphical and numerical methods for describing and
summarising data, Probability, Population distributions, Sampling variability and
sampling distributions, Estimation using a single sample, Hypothesis testing a
single sample, Comparing two populations or treatments, Simple linear regression and correlation, Case studies

**Weightage:**
30% Endsem, 20% Midsem, 20% quizzes (2 quizzes, 10% each), 20% Assignments (3-4 assignments + a few online quizzes), 10% Group Project

**How are the Lectures/Labs for this course?**
Lectures are really good. Sir explains concepts well, giving examples. You might find the pace of the course slow initially but Sir paces through the topics towards the end of the course. A lecture in the beginning was dedicated to Canopy installation and a few lectures in the beginning were dedicated to basic Python concepts and libraries (numpy, matplotlib et cetera). 

**How are the Assignments & Projects for this course?:**
Assignments were not tough, and basic. It helped us practise python programming and applying libraries such as numpy, pandas et cetera. The project at the end, to be done in groups of 4-5 was really interesting and some really good work was done by teams. The project enabled us to assimilate the concepts well and apply them to real life datasets. My team modelled the GDP of India as a function of various parameters (for example net exports, agricultural output et cetera in a year) over the years. We predicted the GDP of India in 2030 and compared our results to the online estimates.

**How are the Exams (Quizzes, Mid-sem and End-sem) for this course?**
Quizzes and midsem were quite basic and involved nothing but basic understanding of the course content. Reading the prescribed content from the book, Sheldon Ross even once was enough to score well. Endsem had a few really nice questions and required good understanding of some of the difficult concepts in the course (Hypothesis Testing and other concepts covered in the later half). 

**Other Remarks:**
1. Don't miss classes after the midsems as certain important non-trivial concepts are discussed which might be difficult to follow if not understood. 
2. Everything is covered nicely in the book, so read the chapters in the syllabus.
