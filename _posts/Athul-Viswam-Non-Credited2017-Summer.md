**Project Guide:** Prof Rajkumar S Pant

**Time Commitment Required:** 4 - 8 hrs per week

**Project Description:**  
This project involved me, a friend of mine from mechanical and a PhD student in aerospace department. All of us were working on different parts of the project. I was involved in shape generation algorithm designing, testing and coupling our designed algorithm with natural optimization algorithms like GA, SA, etc. other members were in charge of developing surrogate models and sizing methodologies. It took around a month to arrive at a suitable algorithm which can give us the results in few hours. Finally, we arrived at a new design of airship which can carry 30% more payload than the current used version. A paper based on this work had been presented in an international conference in London by one of my co-authors. 

**Grading:** Very Strict

**This Project has:** Programming/Coding, Literature Review, Simulations, Theoretical Formulation

**Recommended Prerequisites:** EDO

**Other Areas of Interest of the Project Guide:** Optimization, LTA technology, aircraft design

**Remarks by author:**  
It involved extensive use of MATLAB and Python. In the first half of the project, we had issues with the algorithm. It was running for more than 8 hours for a single simulation. Later on we found some better techniques with which we reduced the running time of the algorithm.
