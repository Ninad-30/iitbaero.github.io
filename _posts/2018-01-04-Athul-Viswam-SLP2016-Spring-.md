**Project Guide:** Prof Rajkumar S Pant

**Time Commitment Required:** 1 - 4 hrs per week

**Project Description:**  
This was the first long term project I took in my UG years. As the title indicates, it involved complete analysis of airships, or in general blunt bodies using CFD. The data generated had to be validated from the literature. A detailed study of blunt body shape parameterisation algorithms (for this project, we used Gertler's shape parameterisation algorithm was used) was done and the efficacy had to be tested with existing designs. In the second part, CFD simulation was carried out for airships using ANSYS FLUENT. 

**Grading:** Very Strict

**This Project has:** Programming/Coding, Literature Review, Simulations, Theoretical Formulation

**Recommended Prerequisites:** Ae 152

**Other Areas of Interest of the Project Guide:** Optimization, LTA technology, aircraft design

**Remarks by author:**  
It was a great time doing it, though I struggled a bit because I was in my 4th semester. But the faculty member was very much supportive and helpful.
