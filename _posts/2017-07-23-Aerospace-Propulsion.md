**Course Instructor:** Prof. Sudarshan Kumar

**Course Difficulty:** Moderate

**Time Commitment Required:** Moderate

**Grading:** About right

**Attendance Policy:** 80 % attendance mandatory and DX is enforced

**This Course has:** Quizzes, Assignment(s), Mid-Sem, End-Sem

**Prerequisites:** AE223: Thermodynamics & Propulsion, AE236: Compressible Fluid Mechanics

**Topics Covered in the Course:**  
Classification of rockets, Nozzle flow and types of nozzles, combustion study, Solid propellant rockets, Liquid propellant rockets and fuel injection meachanisms

**How are the Lectures/Labs for this course?**  
The professor covers only small amounts of information each class and it is easy to keep track using the provided references. The professor gives lots of numeric data for comparison which may make the lectures tedious sometimes. 

**How are the Assignments & Projects for this course?**  
The assignment required the use of an open source rocket systems study software which is quite interesting. The assignment is easy but would require you to put in appropriate amount of time. 

**How are the Exams (Quizzes, Mid-sem and End-sem) for this course?**  
The questions in quizzes and exams are quite different from what you would expect. The questions would vary from asking certain numeric values and in some cases derivation of equations for certain scenarios. The quality of the questions was good however. 

**Other Remarks:**  
Please ensure to attend the classes, DX grade will be given for low attendance.
