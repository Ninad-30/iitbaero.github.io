**Course Instructor:** Prof. Rajkumar Pant

**Course Difficulty:** Easy

**Time Commitment Required:** High

**Grading:** About right

**Attendance Policy:** No DX enforced but attendance contributes to grade

**This Course has:** Quizzes, Assignment(s), Project(s)

**Prerequisites:** None

**Topics Covered in the Course:**  
Types of lighter-than-air(LTA) systems, principles for working of LTA systems, design of LTA systems, case studies of use of LTA systems

**Weightage:**  
Attendance & Class Participation,10%  
Quizzes,6,20%  
Assignments,2,20%  
Minor Project(instead of midsem),20%  
Major Project(instead of endsem),30%

**How are the Lectures/Labs for this course?**  
The course follows an inverted classroom format hence would require the student to watch the lectures required before coming to the class. The classroom activity would consist of clarification of doubts on the topic and for discussing the status of projects. Classes would also consist of extra videos and information which the professor would explain.

**How are the Assignments & Projects for this course?**  
The assignments which my batch had was a 3 minute talk and a coding assignment. The assignments are relatively easy if you put in a little effort. This course has projects in place of mid-sem and end-sem exams and also carry significant weightage. The projects require building of LTA systems from the knowledge gained as the course progresses. The projects take up a lot of time and would require team effort to get things done. 

**How are the Exams (Quizzes, Mid-sem and End-sem) for this course?**  
The quizzes are neither too easy nor to difficult. It requires you to go through videos thoroughly.   

**Other Remarks:**  
The course is an inverted-classroom so it is expected of the students to participate in the class. This course would take up a lot of time but it is one of the few courses where you design and make systems which would fly.
