**Topics Covered in the Course:**  
Solid as a continuum,  components of stress & strain fields, stress/strain transformation, principal stresses, plane stress/strain, Mohr's circle, equilibrium equations, strain displacement relations, compatibility conditions, natural & kinematic boundary conditions, stress-strain relations,beam theory, buckling of column,idealization of general loads into axial forces, bending moments, shear forces and torque distributions, deflection and stress analysis of rods

**How are the Lectures/Labs for this course?**  
Prof Shimpi believed in students learning rather than a faculty orating the lecture slides. He made us think and derive evry concept from scratch. He taught us in such a way that we need not remember any formuale. Lectures were a bit slower, owing to the fact that a considerable amount of time was used up to make us think.

**How are the Assignments & Projects for this course?**  
No assignments, no projects

**How are the Exams (Quizzes, Mid-sem and End-sem) for this course?**  
Easy - most of the time, direct questions from reference books

**References:**  
Timoshenko's Mechanics of Materials
