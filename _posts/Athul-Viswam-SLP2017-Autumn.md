**Project Guide:** Prof Viren Menezes

**Time Commitment Required:** 1 - 4 hrs per week

**Project Description:**  
The interaction of a shock wave with boundary layer is a recent research topic. Since such interactions are not visible, they weren't studied till a disaster happened in the late 60s. If the reader is an aerospace student, I assume that the reader knows that the leading edge of any surface has to be thermally protected if the body is moving fast(specially when moving with more than 4 times the speed of sound) because it is going to be a stagnation point. But what we miss is the chance of a shock wave interference with the boundary layer developed on the surface which causes local heating at regions far away from leading edge and cause undesired flight parameters and may be even a crash(the reader may check for X-15 accident). This project was aimed to develop a correlation between skin friction(which is not possible to measure in hypersonic field) and heat transfer(very easy to measure using temperature data). The only way was to rely on hypersonic CFD and generate data and do a bit of data analysis. Unfortunately this being a recent research interest, I found hardly any experimental research papers. So I had to rely on other correlations developed by NASA and other universities to test the reliability of my numerical simulation. At the end of the project, we arrived at a good correlation to predict the skin friction coefficient given the heat transfer coefficient.

**Grading:** Very Strict

**This Project has:** Programming/Coding, Literature Review, Simulations, Theoretical Formulation

**Recommended Prerequisites:** Ae 225, ae 236,

**Other Areas of Interest of the Project Guide:** Experimental hypersonics 

**Remarks by author:**  
It was a wonderful experience working in the shock tunnel with the members of VM group. I also got a chance to have a sit through for hypersonic flow theory, a PG elective offered by prof Viren Menezes that sem which catered to the successful completion of the project.
