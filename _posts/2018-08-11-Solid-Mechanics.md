Introduction: Engineering Statics v/s Solid Mechanics, solid as a continuum,
statement of a general solid mechanics problem.
Elements of 2-D & 3-D Elasticity: components of stress & strain fields, stress/strain
transformation, principal stresses, plane stress/strain, Mohr’s circle, equilibrium
equations, strain displacement relations, compatibility conditions, natural &
kinematic boundary conditions, stress-strain relations, generalized Hooke’s Law -
Isotropy, Orthotropy, Anisotropy. Displacement and force methods of analysis.
Concepts of linear and nonlinear problems. Illustration of linear elasticity solutions
- problems in 2-D (rectangular and polar co-ordinates), stress function approach. St.
Venant’s principle.
Material behaviour: introduction to metallic and non-metallic materials of aerospace
interest, awareness/overview of structure of materials. Ductile, brittle, elasto-plastic
and viscoelastic material behaviour - Elastic and strength properties. Composite
materials. Materials selection. Failure of engineering materials, failure theories,
concepts of fatigue, fracture and creep.
1-D structural analysis: slender structural elements, assumptions simplifying the
general (3-d) stress, strain and deformation fields for uncoupled axial deformation,
uncoupled bending, and uncoupled twisting of slender 1-D elements and
development elementary beam theory, idealization of general loads into axial forces,
bending moments, shear forces and torque distributions, deflection and stress
analysis of rods, beams and circular shafts. Introduction to energy methods – strain
energy, virtual work, minimum potential energy. Introduction to energy principles
and its applications. Introduction to Truss analysis. Riveted joints.
Measurement of strain and displacement. Measurement of elastic and strength
properties. ASTM standards.

**How are the Lectures/Labs for this course?**
Lectures were uninteresting but important as sir would often ask questions from the discussions in the class. Sir would often get confused regarding what he is teaching. 

**How are the Assignments & Projects for this course?:**
Assignments slightly helped in understanding of the concepts as they involved applying the theory taught in the class to a question. 

**How are the Exams (Quizzes, Mid-sem and End-sem) for this course?:**
Assignments slightly helped in understanding of the concepts as they involved applying the theory taught in the class to a question. 

**Other Remarks:**
None
