**Project Guide:** Prof. Arpita Sinha and Prof. Leena Vachhani

**Time Commitment Required:** 1 - 4 hrs per week

**Project Description:**  
Read up on space-filling curves and their formulation. Surveyed their applications in robotics.
Devised a modified space-filling curve for obstacle avoidance.

**Grading:** About right

**This Project has:** Programming/Coding, Literature Review, Simulations, Theoretical Formulation

**Recommended Prerequisites:** MA 105

**Other Areas of Interest of the Project Guide:** Mobile robotics, Guidance

**Remarks by author:**  
Surveying the literature and then defining my own problem statement was probably the most exciting part of the project. The project was purely mathematical, which was pretty fun too.
