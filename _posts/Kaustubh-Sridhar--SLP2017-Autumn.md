**Project Guide:** Prof. Srikant Sukumar (syscon), Prof. Hemendra Arya

**Time Commitment Required:** 4 - 8 hrs per week

**Project Description:**  
I had to implement a recently published methodology on applying a form of nonlinear control (back stepping) to make a Parrot AR Drone (in a simulation and with the actual drone) follow any given trajectory. All my work was performed in the motion capture system (Vicon) lab on top of the syscon department. This project required extensive amounts of ROS based C++ programming, debugging, tuning, and even patching up the drone when it crashed.

**Grading:** Strict

**This Project has:** Programming/Coding, Literature Review, Lab Experiments, Simulations, Theoretical Formulation

**Recommended Prerequisites:** 

**Other Areas of Interest of the Project Guide:** Control systems, robotics

**Remarks by author:**  
Having done both this and the linear, nonlinear control course as part of my minor in the syscon department at the same time, I could actually use what I've learned and implement it on high-end equipment. This was a big plus.

PM me for a full report on my work.

**How interesting was the project:** Highly Interesting

**How strongly would you recommend someone for taking a similar project (Not recommended-Strongly Recommended)?**  
Strongly Recommended
