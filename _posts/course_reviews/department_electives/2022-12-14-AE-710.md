# Spring 2022
### Prof. Aniruddha Sinha
**Author**: M Vishnu Sankar

**Pre-requisite courses**: Fluid Dynamics

**Pre-requisite skills**: Python/MATLAB programming

**Course Content**:

- FFT
- Green's theorem
- Computational Aeroacoustics

**Motivation to take up the course**: I love Sinha Sir's teaching and any topic related to fluid mechanics

**Information about Projects/Assignments**:

10%: Weekly 5-min. quiz (10x1%)

10%: 30-minute quiz (2x5%)

50%: Homework assignments (4 assignments, 10%, 10%, 20%, 10%)

10%: Literature study report and presentation

20%: Final exam (comprehensive)

2 computational assignments and 2 problem solving type assignments. Assignments are not straight forward, start solving them well before the deadline to finish them on time


**Quizzes/Midsem/Endsem papers Difficulty**: 4/5

**Projects/Assignments Difficulty**: 5/5

<!-- **Overall Course Difficulty**: Moderate -->

<!-- **Average Time Commitment**:
(Apart from lectures and tutorials)
Less than 3 hrs -->


<!-- **Attendance Policy**: There was no attendance policy, but it is recommended to attend lectures (especially tutorials)

**Professor's Teaching Style**: Sinha sir's lecture are amazing, the beautiful mathematical essence and physical intuitions are never missing in his lectures. 

**Should you do this course?**: Anyone interested in understanding the practical and theoretical understanding of Aeroaoustics (computational aspect of it especially) can take this course. It is definitely one of the most 'hot' research topic out there. Has a lot of potential applications on Urban Air Mobility vehicles and supersonic flight travel.
