# Spring 2022
### Prof. Sandip Kumar Saha
**Author**: Sanskar Maddi

**Pre-requisite courses**: AE 225, Heat Transfer (not a hard prereq)

**Pre-requisite skills**: Basic fluids stuff and coding in any language (MATLAB/Python)

**Course Content**:
Review of conservation equations, lumped parameter approach leading to non-linear equations, numerical solutions of non-linear equation. Concept of round off error, overflow, propagation of error. Problems leading to system of linear equations. Techniques for solving system of linear equations (direct and iterative). Scaling and nondimensionalisation. Linear and non linear regression techniques to correlate experimental data. Numerical Integration, calculation of shape factors. Thermal and fluid problems leading to ODE. Initial, Boundary and Eigen value problems. Solutions of ODE using marching and finite difference methods. Characterization of partial differential equations, Numerical solutions of elliptic, parabolic and hyperbolic equations encountered in heat transfer and fluid flow.

**Motivation to take up the course**: 
For people intrested in Computational fluids research , a basic CFD course is a must. And a CFD course covers most stuff required to progress forward.
