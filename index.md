# What is Aerospace Engineering?

<div style="text-align: justify">
Starting from the stone age, we have built a computer generation now.
Somewhere in between we saw a dream, to fly, to touch the sky, a dream
which didn’t let us sleep, for days, for months and for years. In the beginning of
the 20 th century, the world saw the birth of an engineering discipline. It rapidly
expanded it’s wings, over the years, a speed with which no technology grew,
nurtured by the people who made history. Yes, It is nothing but the Aerospace
Engineering, the technology which gave wings to our desire to fly, the
technology which put man on moon, the technology which made us move
faster than the speed of sound which was once thought to be impossible, a
technology.

Aerospace engineering is a diverse and rapidly changing field which includes
four major technologies: aerodynamics, dynamics and control, propulsion, and
structures and materials. The primary application of aerospace engineering is
the design and development of aircraft, missiles and spacecraft. However,
aerospace engineering may also be applied to other vehicles and systems such
as submarines, automobiles, trains, trucks, buses and rapid transit.
